	<h2> Early on </h2>
	<p>
			On 12 August 1887, Schrodinger was born in Vienna, Austria,
			to Rudolf Schrodinger (cerecloth producer, botanist) and Georgine
			Emilia Brenda (daughter of Alexander Bauer, Professor of Chemistry, Technische Hochschule Vienna). He was their only child.
			His mother was of half Austrian and half English descent; his father was Catholic and his mother was Lutheran. 	Despite being raised in a religious household, he called himself an atheist.
			However, he had strong interests in Eastern religions, pantheism and used religious symbolism in his works. He also believed his scientific work was an approach to the godhead, albeit in a metaphorical sense.
	</p>
	<p>
			He was also able to learn English outside of school, as his maternal grandmother was British. Between 1906 and 1910 Schrödinger studied in Vienna under Franz S. Exner (1849–1926) and Friedrich Hasenohrl (1874–1915).
			He also conducted experimental work with Karl Wilhelm Friedrich "Fritz" Kohlrausch.
			In 1911, Schrodinger became an assistant to Exner.
			At an early age, Schrodinger was strongly influenced by Arthur Schopenhauer.
			As a result of his extensive reading of Schopenhauer's works, he became deeply interested throughout his life in colour theory and philosophy.
		  In his lecture "Mind and Matter", he said that "The world extended in space and time is but our representation." This is a repetition of the first words of Schopenhauer's main work.
	</p>
	<h2> The Middle Years </h2>
	<p>
			Erwin Schrödinger as a young scientist.
			In 1914 Erwin Schrödinger achieved Habilitation.
			Between 1914 and 1918 he participated in war work as a commissioned officer in the Austrian fortress artillery (Gorizia, Duino, Sistiana, Prosecco, Vienna).
			In 1920 he became the assistant to Max Wien, in Jena, and in September 1920 he attained the position of ao. Prof. roughly equivalent to Reader (UK) or associate professor (US), in Stuttgart.
			In 1921, he became o. Prof. (ordentlicher Professor, i.e. full professor), in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland).
</p>
<p>
			In 1921, he moved to the University of Zurich. In 1927, he succeeded Max Planck	at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin.
			In 1934, however, Schrodinger decided to leave Germany; he disliked the Nazis' anti-semitism.
		  He became a Fellow of Magdalen College at the University of Oxford.
			Soon after he arrived, he received the Nobel Prize together with Paul Dirac.
		 	His position at Oxford did not work out well; his unconventional domestic arrangements, sharing living quarters with two women was not met with acceptance.
</p>
<p>
			In 1934, Schrodinger lectured at Princeton University; he was offered a permanent position there, but did not accept it.
			Again, his wish to set up house with his wife and his mistress may have created a problem.
		 	He had the prospect of a position at the University of Edinburgh but visa delays occurred, and in the end he took up a position at the University of Graz in Austria in 1936.
	 		He had also accepted the offer of chair position at Department of Physics, Allahabad University in India.
			In the midst of these tenure issues in 1935, after extensive correspondence with Albert Einstein, he proposed what is now called the Schrodinger's cat thought experiment.
</p>
<h2> Later In Life </h2>
<p>
			In 1938, after the Anschluss, Schrodinger had problems because of his flight from Germany in 1933 and his known opposition to Nazism.
			He issued a statement recanting this opposition (he later regretted doing so and personally apologized to Einstein).
			However, this did not fully appease the new dispensation and the University of Graz dismissed him from his job for political unreliability.
			He suffered harassment and received instructions not to leave the country, but he and his wife fled to Italy.
			From there, he went to visiting positions in Oxford and Ghent University.
</p>
<p>
			In the same year he received a personal invitation from Ireland's Taoiseach, Eamon de Valera, to reside in Ireland and agree to help establish an Institute for Advanced Studies in Dublin.
			He moved to Clontarf, Dublin, became the Director of the School for Theoretical Physics in 1940 and remained there for 17 years.
			He became a naturalized Irish citizen in 1948, but retained his Austrian citizenship.
			He wrote about 50 further publications on various topics, including his explorations of unified field theory.
			In 1944, he wrote <i>What Is Life?</i>, which contains a discussion of negentropy and the concept of a complex molecule with the genetic code for living organisms.
			According to James D. Watson's memoir, <i>DNA, the Secret of Life</i>, Schrödinger's book gave Watson the inspiration to research the gene, which led to the discovery of the DNA double helix structure in 1953.
			Similarly, Francis Crick, in his autobiographical book <i>What Mad Pursuit</i>, described how he was influenced by Schrödinger's speculations about how genetic information might be stored in molecules.
</p>
<p>
		Schrödinger stayed in Dublin until retiring in 1955.
		He had a lifelong interest in the Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism, which influenced his speculations at the close of <i>What Is Life?</i> about the possibility that individual consciousness is only a manifestation of a unitary consciousness pervading the universe.
		A manuscript "Fragment From An Unpublished Dialogue of Galileo" from this time recently resurfaced at The King's Hospital boarding school, Dublin after it was written for the
		School's 1955 edition of their <i>Blue Coat</i> to celebrate his leaving of Dublin to take up his appointment as Chair of Physics at the University of Vienna.
		In 1956, he returned to Vienna.
		At an important lecture during the World Energy Conference he refused to speak on nuclear energy because of his skepticism about it and gave a philosophical lecture instead.
		During this period Schrödinger turned from mainstream quantum mechanics' definition of wave–particle duality and promoted the wave idea alone, causing much controversy.
