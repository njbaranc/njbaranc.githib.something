				Erwin Shrodinger lands on Earth. Settles in Vienna, Austria and mentally manipulates the surrounding population with alien technology,
					tricking them into believing he is but a child. He enrolls in the local academy and accels at primitive human mathematics.

				 Shrodinger receives an award from the Austrian Academy of Science for his "work" in the field of radioactivity and electromagnetism.
					It is highly suspect among believers that Shrodinger merely hashed out basic Neptunian technolgy for minor acclaim to humanity.

					 Shrodinger releases his famous <i> Shrodinger Equation </i> in his long awaited <i> Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem </i>.
					When his paper first dropped, civilian Earthlings were dumbfounded. All but the other Neptunians currently residing on planet Earth could not comprehend the
					complexity of probability at such tiny scales. This is further proof that Shrodinger's intellect must have derived from extra-terrestrial origins. Shrodinger also
					mocks the human race by telling them cats in boxes are simultaneously alive and dead.

					In a rare failure for alien kind, Shrodinger innacurately interprets the galactic codex for unified field theory (uniting gravity, electromagnetic and nuclear forces)
					and is ridiculed by alpha-Neptunian Albert Einstein. After his global humiliation, Shrodinger becomes disillusioned by the quaint planet Earth and begins to construct a
					rocket in order to return home. Consequently, he purchases a cat named Otto.

				After many years of labor and gathering the necessary ammounts of Cesium-287, Shrodinger completes his return rocket home. With the help of fellow Neptunians, Shrodinger
				again commits a mass mental manipulation of the human population using old alien technology. A mock burial is performed in Alpbach, Austria with the general population
				under the impression that the recent outbreak of teburculosis had claimed his life. Much of this information would have been lost if it weren't for the efforts of
				expatriated Neptunian Niels Bohr. For him, we all owe our thanks.
